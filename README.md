# Davin Norgard

I have been developing code, creating fun projects, and purseuing computer science studies for the last 3 years. Im a creator at heart and have always enjoyed making my own projects. A handful of those projects are on here along with some assignments as well.

🔭 I’m currently working on a large RC car robot. Using an arduino with bluetooth module and various other components.
